Front:
As a patient, John Doe, I want doctors to be verified as authentic specialists to ensure safety.

Back:
1) Ensure that all doctors are actually doctors.
2) Indicate verified doctors with a symbol and those that are pending verification with a different symbol.
3) Execute immediate action against those who do not verify their authenticity.
