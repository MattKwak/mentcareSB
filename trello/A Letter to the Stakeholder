Greetings.

It may seem that my team is chaotic and sometimes elsewhere. I prefer to think of them as a dynamic and flexible group, simply exercising their want for Millennial desires.

I do not think this is a problem. I have faith in my teamâ€™s abilities and trust that they will provide. They have. Not once have I been let down; though, that is not to say that there were never any impediments. There were as many as a standard Java error log: a lot. Despite this, they do their best and their best is worthwhile. I hope you can understand this, but it is okay if you don't. 

In any case, I look forward to seeing what you think of what we were able to do. I think you will be pleased.

Sincerely,

Scrum Master-Servant J
Sounds good
