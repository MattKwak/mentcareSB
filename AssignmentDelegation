To make sure everyone is able to commit at least something to the project we are going to change how duties in the project 
are delegated.  Anyone can pick a handful of requirements that they can fulfill themselves by going onto the sprint board and dragging
anything on the "To-Do" list to "In Progress".  

For instance, if I wanted to do requirements 1-3 on the project I'll take drag these requirements from "To-Do" to "In Progress".

Anyone with questions can ask on the groupchat.
